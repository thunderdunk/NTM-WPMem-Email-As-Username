Plugin Name: Email as Username for WP-Members - Heptagon Edit
Description: Requires WP-Members to be in use. Uses members' emails as their usernames. Removes the need to create a username (if wp-members is in use). Changes or removes appropriate items from forms, and adds the email address as the username. If WP-Members is no longer in use, there are plenty of plugins that offer this capability for WP's native registration and login functions
